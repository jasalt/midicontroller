Ideas, notes and some code for an ideal minimal dj midi controller.

## Concept sketch 1

## Prototype from 2014

A semi working build for related `sketch.ino` arduino source code file. This one replaces the second 8-knob area with a Synaptics laptop touchpad that would be used as XY-controller (there's some notes for it's usage in the subdirectory). Strongly influenced by [The 5$ Karduinoss pad (by buZztiaan)](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-5-Karduinoss-pad/?ALLSTEPS).

## Status on 2016 summer

"I you really wan't to DJ, then don't build the controller by yourself as the first thing for f***'s sake!" -- [A friend](http://users.jyu.fi/~nieminen/) on beginning of 2016.

..so I got an integrated DJ controller with bundled Serato DJ (for which I dual boot osx on my Thinkpad) and learned to play with it, until it failed and currently I'm looking forward into building a robust portable DJ'ing setup with Akai AMX & Mixxx. 

Writing more about that on https://github.com/jasalt/www.chronicoverengineering.com blog soon.
